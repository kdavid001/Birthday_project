Dear [Name],

Another year added to your life stack! As Computer Engineers, we don’t always debug life perfectly—but birthdays are the perfect break point for celebration.

May your memory never leak, your joy overflow, and your cake be as sweet as your code.

Cheers to you,
Department of Computer Engineering
